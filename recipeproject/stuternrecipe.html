    <h3>Steps to follow:</h3>
    <h4>Yam Prep:</h4>
    <p>Step 1: Yam and Egg sauce is a happy meal so turn on your favourite playlist and tune in to your happy place </p>
    <p>Step 2: Take the tuber(s) of yam out of its hiding place and start slicing. </p>
    <p><b>Pro-tip:</b> Do a head count of all and sundry who would be partaking in this joyful meal and slice according to how much they can eat. <i>An average person eats two slices.</i> </p>
    <p>Step 3: After slicing and peeling (surely you knew you were supposed to peel), rinse till water runs clear.</p>
    <p>Step 4: Now throw it in a pot of water and put on medium heat. Add a teaspoon or half a table-spoon of salt to taste </p>
     <p>(whispers) <b>Psst..</b> <i>You can be extra and add sugar instead of salt or use both of them. Just do you.</i>  </p>
    <p>Step 5: In about 30-45 minutes, depending on how small you cut the yams, the yams should be ready. So you can take it off and drain but if you like soggy yams, you're free to leave it in the water</p>
    
    <h4>Egg sauce Prep:</h4>
    <p>While the yam is boiling and you're vibing to your favorite afrobeat playlist which I believe includes Davido, you can start preparing your egg sauce. It's called time management sis*</p>
    <p>*- Kindly note that sis used in this context is gender-neutral</p>
    <p>Step 1: Chop the chop-ables: This includes your peppers, tomatoes and onions </p>
    <p>Step 2: Pour 200ml or about 14 tablespoons of vegetable oil into a pan on medium heat </p>
    <p>Step 3: When the oil is hot enough to fry you can now put in the chopped veggies and about half a tea-spoon of salt and leave to fry for about 5 minutes. Kindly pay attention during this process and stir intermittently so it doesn't burn </p>
    <p>Step 4: Crack open your eggs into a bowl, beat it and pour into the frying mix </p>
    <p>Step 5: Wait for about 10 seconds so that it cooks a little then start scrambling like your life depends on it </p>
    <p>Step 6: In 2 minutes, it should be well-cooked and now you can do a taste test</p>
    <p>Finally, your meal is ready so you can plate it and eat your delicious boiled yams and egg sauce.</p>
